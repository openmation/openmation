## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Simplest Automation is built with a focus on:

- **Elegance** — UI inspired by Linear.app, Apple, and Notion
- **Reliability** — Pixel-perfect replay through keystroke-level recording
- **Simplicity** — No complex setup, just record and run
- **Accessibility** — Full keyboard support, dark/light modes

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/automations/:id` | Get automation by ID |
| `POST` | `/api/automations` | Create a new shared automation |
| `GET` | `/run/:id` | Landing page for shared automation |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check endpoint |

### Rate Limits
- General API: 100 requests/hour per IP
- Create automation: 20 requests/hour per IP

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Extension

The extension stores data in `chrome.storage.local`:
- `automations` — Array of saved automations
- `runHistory` — Array of run history entries
- `onboardingComplete` — Boolean for first-time user flow

### Backend

Environment variables:
```bash
PORT=3002  # Server port (default: 3002)
```

Data stored in `data/automations.db` (SQLite).

## 📝 Event Types

The recorder captures these event types:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `click` | Mouse clicks on elements |
| `dblclick` | Double clicks |
| `keydown` | Individual key presses |
| `keyup` | Key releases (for special keys) |
| `focus` | Element focus (form fields) |
| `blur` | Element blur (triggers validation) |
| `change` | Value changes (selects, checkboxes) |
| `scroll` | Page/element scrolling |
| `submit` | Form submissions |
| `navigate` | Page navigations |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Could not establish connection" error
The content script may not be injected. Try:
1. Refresh the page
2. Make sure you're not on a `chrome://` or `chrome-extension://` page

### Form values not submitting correctly
Ensure the form field receives `blur` event before submission. The recorder now captures blur events to trigger validation.

### Automation clicks wrong element
The replayer uses multiple strategies to find elements. If an element changes between recording and replay, try:
1. Record with the page in a consistent state
2. Use unique IDs or data-testid attributes on elements
